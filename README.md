Project Overview: Multi-Agent Personalized Recipe Generator

Description: This version of the project will use multiple agents, each with specific roles to improve the recipe generation process and user interaction.
Agents:

    Ingredient Matcher Agent:
        Role: Analyzes the user’s input to identify the available ingredients and suggests possible additions based on common pairings.
        Function: Returns a list of ingredients that can be included in the recipe based on what the user has.

    Recipe Generator Agent:
        Role: Generates recipes using the ingredients provided by the Ingredient Matcher.
        Function: Uses an LLM to create a recipe that is unique to the user's input and dietary preferences.

    Nutrition Advisor Agent:
        Role: Analyzes the generated recipe for nutritional content and suggests healthier alternatives or additions.
        Function: Provides feedback on calories, proteins, carbs, etc., and recommends adjustments.

    Feedback Collector Agent:
        Role: Collects user feedback on recipes generated.
        Function: Gathers ratings and comments to improve future recipe suggestions and can implement a simple learning mechanism based on user preferences.

Implementation Steps:

    Set Up the Environment:
        Follow the same initial setup as before with your tech stack.

    Create the Input Form:
        Allow users to input ingredients and select dietary preferences as before.

    Develop the Ingredient Matcher Agent:
        Implement logic to parse the input ingredients and match them with common pairings (e.g., “chicken” with “garlic”).
        Consider a simple database or API to suggest complementary ingredients.

    Develop the Recipe Generator Agent:
        Integrate the LLM to generate recipes using the matched ingredients.
        Ensure this agent receives input from the Ingredient Matcher to tailor the recipe.

    Develop the Nutrition Advisor Agent:
        Implement a simple nutrition analysis using a nutrition API (like Edamam or Nutritionix) or a static database.
        Provide suggestions for healthier options or ingredient substitutions.

    Develop the Feedback Collector Agent:
        Create a feedback form for users to rate recipes and leave comments.
        Store this information in your database for future analysis and improvements.

    User Interface:
        Design the UI to display the flow between agents (e.g., ingredient suggestions, generated recipes, and nutrition info).
        Use modals or separate sections to show feedback forms.

    Testing:
        Test the interactions between agents to ensure smooth communication and proper data flow.

    Deployment:
        Deploy your app using a cloud service.

Additional Features:

    Recipe History: Allow users to save favorite recipes and their ratings for future reference.
    Social Sharing: Enable users to share recipes on social media.
    Meal Planning: Introduce a feature where users can plan meals for the week based on generated recipes.

Learning Resources:

    Familiarize yourself with APIs for ingredient matching and nutrition analysis.
    Explore multi-agent systems in programming, focusing on how to manage interactions between them.

This multi-agent architecture will not only enhance your project but also give you valuable experience in working with complex systems and APIs!
